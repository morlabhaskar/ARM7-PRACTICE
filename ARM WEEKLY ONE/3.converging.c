3. Create a display on 8 LEDâ€™s (4-active high and 4-active low) connected to port0 (0.0- 0.7) in the given pattern.
    a. First all LEDs should be OFF, at 1st second, LED 0 and LED 7 (P0.0 and P0.7) should be ON
    b. At 2nd second, LED 1 and LED 6 (P0.1 and P0.6) should be ON
    c. At 3rd second, LED 2 and LED 5 (P0.2 and P0.5) should be ON
    d. At 4th second, LED 3 and LED 4 (P0.3 and P0.4) should be ON
    e. Repeat above pattern for 5 times and stop the process.
